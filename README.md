# deepfake-detection-xai
A deep learning–based deepfake detection system integrated with explainable AI (XAI) techniques to enhance transparency in decision-making. Designed for digital forensics, this project detects manipulated media (images/videos) and provides interpretable visual explanations, helping investigators verify authenticity and trust the AI’s conclusions.
